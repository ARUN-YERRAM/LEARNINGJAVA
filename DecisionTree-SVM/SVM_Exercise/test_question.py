Exercise 1: Implement SVM from scratch using Numpy, Pandas

Description:
In this exercise, you will implement a basic Support Vector Machine (SVM) model from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas libraries. The goal is to classify a synthetic dataset into two categories: Non-diabetic and Diabetic.

You are required to:
1. Implement a linear SVM model that:
   - Uses a hyperplane to classify the data samples.
   - Updates weights and bias using gradient descent during training.
2. Test the model by predicting the class of a new data sample.

Dataset overview:
| Feature      | Description                                                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Glucose      | Represents the glucose level of a patient. Higher values indicate potential diabetes. |
| BMI          | Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on weight and height.                    |
| Age          | Age of the patient, contributing to diabetes risk assessment.                         |
| Label        | Binary classification: `0` for Non-diabetic, `1` for Diabetic.                        |

The dataset contains 200 samples, with 100 samples each for Non-diabetic and Diabetic classes. The features are generated synthetically using random sampling, with distinct means for each class to ensure separability.

***Important Instructions***
1. Fill in the missing code to complete this assignment. Missing code is indicated as "# your code here".
2. Boiler plate code is pre-defined for you, the missing logic must be implemented correctly.
3. The "main" method must run and generate output in the format specified in the code, this is important as test cases invoke the main method for evaluation.
